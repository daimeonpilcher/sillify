<p>Just last week, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/fashion/50-cent-renaissance-man-southpaw.html?_r=1" target="blank">The New York Times</a> touted <strong>Curtis James Jackson III</strong>, the rapper popularly known as <strong>50 Cent</strong>, aka <strong>Fitty</strong>, as having &quot;exceptional business instincts.&quot; Well, on Monday -- just days after a jury determined the <a href="http://pagesix.com/2015/07/10/50-cent-slapped-with-5m-verdict-in-sex-tape-trial/?utm_source=move&amp;utm_medium=manualsyndication&amp;utm_campaign=partnerfeed" target="blank">star must pay $5 million</a> to a woman whose private sex video he posted online where he mocked both her and her boyfriend -- Fitty filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p> 
<p>Let's be real here for a second. We're talking about an artist whose debut album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin',&quot; went platinum six times and pretty much assured that he wouldn't be killing himself on the road to riches. (He's already survived nine bullets, after all.) If Fitty is indeed in a cash crunch, he has plenty of disposable assets to fall back on. We suggest he start by finally unloading his <a href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Farmington_CT" target="blank">Farmington, CT,</a> estate to cover the payout.</p> 
<p>The <a href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/50-Poplar-Hill-Dr_Farmington_CT_06032_M44439-07557" target="blank">21-bedroom, 25-bathroom mansion</a>, which takes up 48,515 square feet, was listed in 2007 for $18.5 million. Replete with a nightclub, billiard room, conference room, media room, and racquetball court, the home has had its price slashed nearly <em>fitty percent </em>to $9.9M.</p> 
<p>Given his financial and legal woes, we have a few suggestions for where 50 could relocate so he can stay local.</p>

<p><strong>Crib No. 1:</strong> <a title="135 Birdseye Rd, Farmington, CT 06032 " href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/135-Birdseye-Rd_Farmington_CT_06032_M40101-40885?row=1" target="blank"><span>135 Birdseye Rd</span>, <span>Farmington</span>, <span>CT</span> </a><span> <a title="135 Birdseye Rd, Farmington, CT 06032 " href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/135-Birdseye-Rd_Farmington_CT_06032_M40101-40885?row=1" target="blank">06032<br /> </a></span><strong>The Benjamins</strong>: $199,900<br /> <strong>Da Lowdown</strong><span>: The cozy two-bedroom, one-bathroom, 1,176-square-foot ranch has easy highway access and good proximity to schools (Jackson has two sons). The listing says it's &quot;great for downsizing.&quot; Jackson can still keep a low profile as the properly is &quot;beautifully landscaped with a private backyard&quot; and has a decent-size deck and patio.</span></p>

<p><strong>Crib No. 2: </strong> <a title="3 Redstone Way, Farmington, CT 06032 " href="http://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/3-Redstone-Way_Farmington_CT_06032_M31246-49784?row=2" target="blank"><span>3 Redstone Way</span>, <span>Farmington</span>, <span>CT</span> <span>06032<br /> </span></a><strong>The Benjamins:</strong> $232,000<br /> <strong>Da Lowdown: </strong>The listing dubs it &quot;the most beautiful condo at Meadow Farms!&quot; Fitty would score bamboo floors, an updated kitchen with maple cabinetry, stainless-steel appliances, quartz countertops, and a breakfast bar within the two-bedroom, 2.5-bathroom, 1,396-square-foot spot. The rapper, who's known to have a taste for the finer things, should note the crown molding detail throughout the downstairs. And if 50 has to give up his fleet of luxury wheels, he's in luck -- the property is walking distance to the Farmington River and Rails to <span>Trails systems! </span></p>
